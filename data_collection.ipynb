All I knew was that it had something to do with typing complicated stuff on a computer. I got the idea of  learning how to code after I graduated with an Economics Degree from a university in London. Economics is a highly valued degree, most people who do it in top universities like mine become investment bankers and stuff like that. I did an internship at a big bank too, but I hated it. So I started looking into what career path could give me a lot of money, and also a great work-life balance. So I discovered, software engineering.\n\nI learned that to become a software engineer, all you really need is to know how to code. So I typed on Google, how to learn to code, and I ended up starting with Python for Everybody and the Odin Project, these are both free resources, the former introduced me to one of the most popular programming languages of today, Python, and the latter familiarized me with the basics of Web Development using HTML, CSS and Javascript.\n\nAt this point my goal was just to get a vague sense of the vast world of programming, to start understanding what was out there, how the different pieces like front-end and backend development fit together and what they mean at a high level. Going through the Odin Project I got a basic sense for many interesting topics such as how the internet works and what it actually means to open a web page on your browser.\n\nI will also tell you how I got my first job in tech as a Software Engineer..\n\nDISCLAIMER: some of the links in the description may be affiliate links.
